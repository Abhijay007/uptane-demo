This diagram illustrates how the checks and balances of this system works. The connected components on the right hand side of the diagram are on the vehicle, while the components on the left hand-side represent the repositories. The Image repository can be thought of as an unchanging source of information about images. It is the keeper of every image currently deployed by the OEM, along with the metadata files that prove their authenticity. The Director repository knows what software should be distributed to each ECU, given the current state of the repository. Many ECUs do not have clocks, and so may use an external source to provide a secure source of time.","sidebar":"LearnMoreSidebar"},"LearnMore/gettingStarted":{"id":"LearnMore/gettingStarted","title":"Getting Started","description":"","sidebar":"LearnMoreSidebar"},"LearnMore/History/alliance-history":{"id":"LearnMore/History/alliance-history","title":"Uptane: A JDF/Linux Foundation Project","description":"The Uptane Alliance was formally established in July of 2018 for the express purpose of standardizing an open and secure design for over-the-air updates for automobiles. In practice, this process has involved improving and standardizing the Uptane open-source software. Under the umbrella of IEEE\'s International Standards and Technology Organization, the Alliance released IEEE-ISTO 6100.1.0.0 Uptane Standard for Design and Implementation, its first set of standards, in July of 2019\\\\. Shortly after this release, the initiative affiliated with the Joint Development Foundation of the Linux Foundation. The new legal name of the Alliance is now Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, Uptane Series, but it remains a nonprofit consortium of professionals from industry, companies, non-profit groups, and government agencies. In addition to developing, disseminating and supporting the implementation of standards to improve the security of software updates for the automotive industry, the group will also oversee the continuing development and adoption of Uptane technology.","sidebar":"LearnMoreSidebar"},"LearnMore/History/overview-history":{"id":"LearnMore/History/overview-history","title":"Project Overview","description":"Uptane is the first software update security system for the automotive industry capable of resisting even attacks by nation-state level actors. It is designed in such a manner that the security of software updates does not degrade all at once, but follows a hierarchy in which different levels of access to vehicles or the automaker\'s infrastructure must be gained. By building these levels into the security system, even if an attacker compromises servers, bribes operators, or gains access to vehicular networks, he or she is prevented from causing many types of harm to the vehicle.","sidebar":"LearnMoreSidebar"},"LearnMore/History/timeline-history":{"id":"LearnMore/History/timeline-history","title":"Timeline","description":"2010: A predecessor technology of Uptane, The Update Framework (TUF), which secures software updates on repositories, is introduced in an academic research paper, coauthored by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos.","sidebar":"LearnMoreSidebar"},"LearnMore/press":{"id":"LearnMore/press","title":"Press","description":"- Now Your Car is a Cybersecurity Risk, Too-May 21, 2021","sidebar":"LearnMoreSidebar"},"LearnMore/publications":{"id":"LearnMore/publications","title":"Publications","description":"- Survivable Key Compromise in Software Update Systems: Presented at the 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS\'10) in Chicago, Illinois, in 2010\\\\.
