An OEM with an existing OTA system has two methods to implement Uptane: either buy an off-the-shelf solution and integrate with it, or build a custom solution, with some greater or smaller degree of reliance on available open-source client and server components. If a project is starting from scratch, there is a third option: Uptane could be integrated from the start, beginning with the design stage. In that case, the cost of implementing Uptane itself would be minimal, and may even represent a cost reduction, as it provides a framework for organizing the analysis and development that must be undertaken regardless."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"If a user is contemplating options one or two, the relative costs are admittedly more difficult to estimate.

There is also the possibility that the goals of the provider and the OEM could be misaligned, which can make integration difficult and likely expensive.

Therefore, before thinking about cost, potential implementers should do a risk assessment of the current solution, evaluate its weaknesses, and identify the major opportunities for improvement.

There are pros and cons to both options, but ultimately, the issue of cost cannot be determined without also considering the value received for the expense. Value in this case is enhanced security, so when discussing costs, the trade-off between taking shortcuts and sacrificing security, or doing it right and spending more time/money, must be considered.
